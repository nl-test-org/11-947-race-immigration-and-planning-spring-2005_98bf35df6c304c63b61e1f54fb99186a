Students in this course worked in three separate groups to produce final projects for their client addressing three distinct themes: Project Funding, Leadership Training,Â and the Arcade Project. Samples of these projects are included below under the appropriate heading. Due to the client-based nature of the work, the class has chosen to keep their final recommendations to the client private and have included here only an overview of their work. All work is courtesy of the students named and used with permission.
